# Zombie Odyssey (Prototype)

2D top-down zombie survival prototype built with Vanilla JS + HTML Canvas.

This repository is archived as a gameplay prototype used to test:
- Core movement + shooting loop
- Enemy AI + wave spawning
- Class/ability system
- Room/boss staging flow

Next iteration will be developed in a separate repository using:
TypeScript + Phaser 3 + Colyseus (multiplayer).
